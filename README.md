Hello everyone, here I want to introduce to you, what is **SMKSI Short URLs website**.
# What is SMKSI Short URLs
The SMKSI Short URLs is dedicated to SMKSI, KulaiJaya middle schools, and the purpose is to create short URLs. Prior to this, SMKSI and KulaiJaya Middle School used the gg.gg website to produce, but the gg.gg website was extremely unstable. In order to solve this problem, a student specially made this GitHub page and gave the school a very stable short URL, but it has not been authorized by the school.
## Why do schools need to use short URLs?
Starting in 2020, due to COVID-19, all schools must use the Internet to take classes. SMKSI, KulaiJaya Middle School began to use Microsoft Teams for classes. Teachers began to allow students to use Microsoft Forms to fill in the attendance rate of the class. However, the URL of Microsoft Forms is very long and inconvenient, so the teacher must use a short URL for students to fill in the attendance rate of the class. The school teacher discovered the gg.gg website. The website's URL is very short, and the file name of the URL can be customized. The important thing is that the gg.gg website is completely free and there are no restrictions on use.
However, the good times didn't last long, and the gg.gg website could not be connected shortly afterwards, which caused the teacher a very headache.
